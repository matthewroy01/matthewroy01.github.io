### Recreating the first dungeon from The Legend of Zelda

* Action adventure game made in Visual Studio C++
* Team size: 2
* 2017

Made as a final project in "Game Architecture" in C++.

Created with [Nicholas Robbins](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicholas-robbins-professional/), we roughly recreated the first dungeon from Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda.
The project uses a code base we wrote throughout the semester, Allegro 5, and various game programming patterns like Game Loop and a Component System.

### Battle Beetles

* 3D Fighter made in Unity 5
* Team size: 4
* 2017

A summer project, this game is a work in progress.

Battle Beetles aims to capture the sort of over the top scenarios you'd think up as a kid while playing with toys. Battle Beetles is a 3D arena fighter where mechanical beetles use their horns, antennae, and more to come out on top.
