## About MilkShed Games

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MilkShed Games unfortunately decided to close in May of 2021. However, in the meantime we worked on several projects such as [Panic](https://milkshed-games.itch.io/panic-2020) and [RV Punch](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/milkshedgames/rv-punch?ref=dli51r&token=ac7c14af). You can check out what we were up to on our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MilkShedGames). MilkShed Games may not be around anymore, but it is how I spent my time between June 2019 and May 2021!

## Panic

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Panic is a 3D remake of my [original Panic](https://matthewroy.itch.io/panic) game. It included 3D visuals, new enemies, additional levels, and a more expansive menu/scoring systems.

## RV Punch

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RV Punch was a recreation of the [original RV Punch](https://milkshed-games.itch.io/rvpunch) project. It featured a new track, completely new visuals, and a completely new player controller programmed by me. We launched a [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/milkshedgames/rv-punch?ref=dli51r&token=ac7c14af) for it between April 9th, 2021 and May 9th, 2021.
