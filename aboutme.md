I am Matthew Roy, a game programmer and alum of Burlington Vermont's Champlain College class of 2019. Me and a bunch of friends co-founded [MilkShed Games](https://www.milkshedgames.com) out of college to make cool games and help expand the games industry in Vermont. I specialize in gameplay programming.
