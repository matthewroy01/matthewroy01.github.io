### The Original Ten Ideas

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our team was able to brainstorm a list of ten favorite ideas from a few different brainstorming sessions. Here's a list of them and my thoughts on each of them.

**Gardening Robot**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gardening Robot is an idea that derived from an idea from a previous production class. The original idea (see Put Yourself Together Robot) was based around having a robot that the player would be able to swap parts in and out to change how the robot plays. Gardening Robot is a more simplified version where swapping parts is limited to changing out types of gardening tools such as a watering can or shovel. We had decided that the setting of the game would be a desolate planet with your goal being to terraform it. Additionally, as you grow plants, we had an idea to be able to take control of the plants to help combat enemies, with the main gameplay being more based around puzzles using your tools and planting things. The idea of there being "puzzles" I think is this game idea's downfall. With only "puzzles" to think of, and no real main mechanic, this idea eventually got the axe. Additionally, the team agreed that this idea wasn't as unique as some of the other ideas we had.

**Cooking Mama at Gunpoint**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea with a name as strange as it is misleading. Cooking Mama at Gunpoint was an idea derived from how in the Cooking Mama series of game, there isn't really a harsh consequence for failure, so what if the stakes were raised? This idea eventually evolved into a 3D platformer where you play as an upcoming chef who is being threatened by a customer with unreasonable requests. We experimented with the character using various abilities based around the chef's toque, but were unable to come up with a main mechanic we really liked. This idea eventually got scrapped due to it not being super unique.
