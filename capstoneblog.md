### The Original Ten Ideas (part 2, the top three)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From our top ten ideas, we were able to decide on our three favorites and expanded on each of them. They will be what we move forward with when prototyping.

**Rhythm RPG**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A turn-based RPG where your stereotypical party members are actually orchestra members and you perform quick rhythm games to fight. We chose this game because it feels unique, and that we have a lot of unique ideas for characters and mechanics in the game. With having each character playing a different instrument, we came up with the idea of having each character dress in armor similar to their instrument. Additionally, we think having each instrument uniquely weaponized would be an interesting way to explain how playing the music also hurts enemies.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One unique character we've thought of is an organ player who actually rides the organ like a vehicle. The organ's bench would be attached to the organ itself, and the instrument itself would have a steam engine installed, with wheels similar to that of a steam locomotive train, and steam would be expelled from the pipes in the pipe organ as exhaust. The player himself would be some kind of a cross between a Dracula style organist, hopefully with some elements of a train conductor attached, but we're currently concepting this character as of now.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far in terms of gameplay, I'm feeling good enough about how we've described the flow of combat enough to begin prototyping it. So far I've done research into how to make a rhythm game in Unity and found information about using the audio system's timer to make sure the timing can be as accurate as possible. I've prototyped as simple beat that checks to see if you've pressed the button so the next step will be to expand on that concept and get it into a playable loop.

### The Original Ten Ideas (part 1, the cuts)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our team was able to brainstorm a list of ten favorite ideas from a few different brainstorming sessions. Here's a list of the ideas that didn't make the cut and my thoughts on them.

**Gardening Robot**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gardening Robot is an idea that derived from an idea from a previous production class. The original idea (see Put Yourself Together Robot) was based around having a robot that the player would be able to swap parts in and out to change how the robot plays. Gardening Robot is a more simplified version where swapping parts is limited to changing out types of gardening tools such as a watering can or shovel. We had decided that the setting of the game would be a desolate planet with your goal being to terraform it. Additionally, as you grow plants, we had an idea to be able to take control of the plants to help combat enemies, with the main gameplay being more based around puzzles using your tools and planting things. The idea of there being "puzzles" I think is this game idea's downfall. With only "puzzles" to think of, and no real main mechanic, this idea eventually got the axe. Additionally, the team agreed that this idea wasn't as unique as some of the other ideas we had.

**Cooking Mama at Gunpoint**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea with a name as strange as it is misleading. Cooking Mama at Gunpoint was an idea derived from how in the Cooking Mama series of game, there isn't really a harsh consequence for failure, so what if the stakes were raised? This idea eventually evolved into a 3D platformer where you play as an upcoming chef who is being threatened by a customer with unreasonable requests. We experimented with the character using various abilities based around the chef's toque, but were unable to come up with a main mechanic we really liked. This idea eventually got scrapped due to it not being super unique.

**Neon Gladiator**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neon Gladiator is the only multiplayer game that made it onto our list. Players would have moved along tracks, collecting weapons, and trying to time their attacks as they pass each other at hight speeds. I think this idea would have been fun to make and play, but overall we dropped the idea since the majority of the team didn't want to work on another multiplayer game featuring vehicles (three of four of the team worked on [RV Punch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mn1Y-4wrkfY) in the previous year's production).

**My Roommate Cthulu**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be completely honest, this idea originally started as a joke between me and one of our designers. The idea came from a sitcom-esque scenario where some normal guy is rooming with Cthulu for some reason, and the antics that I guess would follow as a result. Other Lovecraftian and Eldritch characters could have also showne up. This idea was never super serious, and I was personally opposed to it especially if the game was going to be heavily text based and somewhat like a dating simulator; it wouldn't have been much fun to program.

**Zombie Rancher**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name of this idea was created from combining multiple ideas together, like an idea of creating a relaxing farm management game similar to Slime Rancher and other ideas involving being a necromancer, essentially farming skeletons and other monsters from the ground. The end result ended up being more similar to the necromancy idea, but you'd use the monsters you created to attack the surrounding area as you level up your army, base, and yourself. I think this idea could have been interesting, but we really never fleshed out how any of the mechanics would have worked. Overall, I think the other ideas we had were simply more well liked than this one was.

**Bullet Seed**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This idea was inspired by a movie that our artist saw, where the final enemy is destroyed by planting seed into him, causing him to be trapped inside the tree that subsequently grew. This idea would have been a 2D platformer where you fire seeds as bullets that grow into plants when they hit things and enemies. The more seeds you'd shoot, the greener a level would become. This idea wouldn't have been difficult to create, but that's the reason we decided against. Doing a 2D platformer wouldn't have been very challenging or unique.

**Put Yourself Together Robot**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I consider to be the pièce de résistance of this list, Put Yourself Together Robot screams scope issues, awful design pipeline, and risk more than any other idea. As mentioned above in the entry for Gardening Robot, Put Yourself Together Robot comes from an idea we had in a previous production course. The player would take on the role of a planet defending robot that got destroyed in an alien attack. After being destroyed, the player would only be able to control the hand of the robot and would have to explore the world in search of the rest of the body parts. By collecting the parts, the player would be able to reassemble the robot in any arrangement, connecting parts whereever there are joints to do so; imagine connecting a leg to the top of the hand and swinging it around like a club, or connecting the head to that and shooting lasers from the eyes down at enemies. This idea raises many questions: how do you design attacks for every possible combination of robot parts? what does the pipeline look like for that? what happens if you introduce multiple bases for limbs such as having two feet? does the robot become bipedal? how do we animate all of this? While this idea would have been impressive if we had pulled it off (especially on the art and programming side) its scope was huge and we felt more confident in some of our other ideas. The idea would have required a lot of research into inverse kinematics and custom animation for swapping parts in and out, but that research now lives on in one of the ideas that did make the cut, Short Giraffe (see "The Original Ten Ideas (part 2, the top three)").
