### The Original Ten Ideas

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our team was able to brainstorm a list of ten favorite ideas from a few different brainstorming sessions. Here's a list of them and my thoughts on each of them.

**Gardening Robot**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gardening Robot is an idea that derived from an idea from a previous production class. The original idea (see Put Yourself Together Robot) was based around having a robot that the player would be able to swap parts in and out to change how the robot plays. Gardening Robot is a more simplified version where swapping parts is limited to changing out types of gardening tools such as a watering can or shovel. We had decided that the setting of the game would be a desolate planet with your goal being to terraform it. Additionally, as you grow plants, we had an idea to be able to take control of the plants to help combat enemies, with the main gameplay being more based around puzzles using your tools and planting things. The idea of there being "puzzles" I think is this game idea's downfall. With only "puzzles" to think of, and no real main mechanic, this idea eventually got the axe. Additionally, the team agreed that this idea wasn't as unique as some of the other ideas we had.
