## Introduction

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello! I am Matthew Roy, and as of starting this blog, I am a fourth year student at Champlain College. I will be writing this blog to keep a record of writing my own game engine through the class EGP-460 Game Engine Design and Implementation taught by Sajid Farooq.

### My Goals and IDEs

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to write my own game engine to explore the inner workings of engines. We've touched on things like this in the past in classes like Game Architecture, where we wrote classes and systems to handle things like sprites, graphics buffers, and objects in our game. That low level aspect of creating parts of a game from scratch has a certain fun to it, and there's pride in writing something from the ground up. To learn more on this subject and to delve further into writing game engine style system from scratch is why I want to make a game engine.

_My final Game Architecture project created alongside Nicholas Robbins, featuring simple box collision._
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside of learning, one main goal I have is to implement a physics and collision system into my engine. Programming snappy collision into a game is one of the most satisfying things to accomplish in my experience, and I want to explore the more complicated aspects of collision with physics. I'm curious to see how applying additional forces and effects such as friction and bounce are calculated in (I imagine similar to how AI steering algorithms blend behaviors, since vectors in physics combine together when there are multiple forces) or things we commonly see in real life like when a rectangle falls onto a surface corner-first, gravity has to then pull the rest of it down, essentially causing it to rotate.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My understanding of IDEs isn't super strong at the moment and I'm not sure what exactly I'm looking for, but one cross platform IDE I've found is [CodeLite](https://codelite.org/ "Codelite's Homepage"). CodeLite is advertised as free, open source, and cross platform. It also boasts that it has an extremely robust code completion system and text parser. By reading some reviews, it seems that CodeLite would be an easy transition for me since it is designed to be a lot like Visual Studio, especially in how it looks. As far as I can tell, CodeLite makes use of Cross Compilation to compile code for multiple platforms beforehand. This way, you can add the compilers you want to include (such as including g++ for use on Linux/Uninx systems) so you can move the project back and forth between OSs without a problem. CodeLite itself also supports nine different operating systems from the get go, including multiple different versions of Windows and Linux/Unix. One of the biggest perks of CodeLite for me is that it's free. From reading reviews of the program, it seems that CodeLite doesn't support certain higher level or advanced features, but for doing lower level things like my experiences in Game Architecture, I think not much will get affected in my workflow.
