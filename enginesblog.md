## Introduction

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello! I am Matthew Roy, and as of starting this blog, I am a fourth year student at Champlain College. I will be writing this blog to keep a record of writing my own game engine through the class EGP-460 Game Engine Design and Implementation taught by Sajid Farooq.

### My Goals and IDEs

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to write my own game engine to explore the inner workings of engines. We've touched on things like this in the past in classes like Game Architecture, where we wrote classes and systems to handle things like sprites, graphics buffers, and objects in our game. That low level aspect of creating parts of a game from scratch has a certain fun to it, and there's pride in writing something from the ground up. To learn more on this subject and to delve further into writing game engine style system from scratch is why I want to make a game engine.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside of learning, one main goal I have is to implement a physics and collision system into my engine. Programming snappy collision into a game is one of the most satisfying things to accomplish in my experience, and I want to explore the more complicated aspects of collision with physics. I'm curious to see how applying additional forces and effects such as friction and bounce are calculated in (I imagine similar to how AI steering algorithms blend behaviors, since vectors in physics combine together when there are multiple forces) or things we commonly see in real life like when a rectangle falls onto a surface corner-first, gravity has to then pull the rest of it down, essentially causing it to rotate.
