### My Plan

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For RoyNet, my goal is create a networking plugin for Unity focused on creating a more streamlined, automated networking experience closer to that of Unreal. The user should be able to take any game object or component and simply mark it as networkable to create a multiplayer game.
