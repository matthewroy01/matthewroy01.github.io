### Battle Beetles

A summer project, this game is a work in progress.

Battle Beetles aims to capture the sort of over the top scenarios you'd think up as a kid while playing with toys. Battle Beetles is a 3D arena fighter where mechanical beetles use their horns, antennae, and more to come out on top.
