## Projects

### Panic

Made over the course of a semester in "Advanced Seminar in Game Programming" in Unity. 

Panic is a 2D, top-down strategy game with horror elements. The player moves around on a grid avoiding enemies and collecting keys to escape each level. Getting seen by an enenmy causing the player to enter Panic Mode. In Panic Mode, the player is freed from the constraints of the grid while enemy AI also changes.

### Battle Beetles

A summer project made in Unity, this game is a work in progress.

Battle Beetles aims to capture the sort of over the top scenarios you'd think up as a kid while playing with toys. Battle Beetles is a 3D arena fighter where mechanical beetles use their horns, antennae, and more to come out on top.

### Recreating the first dungeon from The Legend of Zelda

Made as a final project in "Game Architecture" in C++.

Using a code base we wrote throughout the semester, Allegro, and various game programming patterns like Game Loop and Components, [Nicholas Robbins](https://github.com/telden) and I roughly recreated the first dungeon from Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda.
