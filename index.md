A summer project, this game is a work in progress.

Battle Beetles aims to capture the sort of over the top scenarios you'd think up as a kid while playing with toys. Battle Beetles is a 3D arena fighter where mechanical beetles use their horns, antennae, and more to come out on top.

### Recreating the first dungeon from The Legend of Zelda

Made as a final project in "Game Architecture" in C++.

Using a code base we wrote throughout the semester, Allegro, and various game programming patterns like Game Loop and Components, [Nicholas Robbins](https://github.com/telden) and I roughly recreated the first dungeon from Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda.
