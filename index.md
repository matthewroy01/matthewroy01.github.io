### WASH Water Trucking and Cost Recovery for Water Systems

* Educational Software
* Made with Phaser 3
* Team makeup: 2 programmers, 2 designers/producers
* July 2020 - May 2021

WASH is a learning tool designed to teach users about water turcking and cost reocvery mechanisms in relation to maintaining local water systems in communities. It was created both [in English](https://get.disasterready.org/water-trucking-and-cost-recovery-online-training/) and [in Arabic](https://get.disasterready.org/water-trucking-and-cost-recovery-online-training/).

I worked on the project as a contracted programmer through [Weathered Sweater](https://www.weatheredsweater.com/) and working with [GameTheory](https://www.gametheoryco.com/).

Contributions involved programming in **Javascript** with **Phaser 3** with some minor HTML and CSS. The project was built with the SCORM 2004 platform and for the Cornerstone LMS. The project is split into several "games" that each have multiple activities including things like dialogue, flipcards, labs, or drag and drop. The activities run on a data driven system and the details of each activity are defined with json data. Additionally, the project involved working with designers and recreating visual layouts created by them.

### Panic

* Strategy
* Made in Unity 2017.2
* Team size: solo
* 2017

Panic was made for Advanced Seminar in Game Programming while studying abroad in Montreal.

Panic is a 2D, top-down strategy game with horror elements. The player moves around on a grid avoiding enemies and collecting keys to escape each level. Getting seen by an enemy causes the player to enter Panic Mode. In Panic Mode, the player is freed from the constraints of the grid while enemy AI also changes.

* Action Game
* Made in Unity 2017.3
* Team size: 4 (Game Jam)
* 2018

Opportunity Knocks is a game made for the Global Game Jam 2018 with the theme of "transmission".

Opportunity Knocks has the player controlling a Mars rover remotely from a computer, but the connection is terrible! Use the boost button to increase the framerate but keep an eye on how much power is remaining or else it's game over. The game is played with the num pad where the 3 left and 3 rights buttons control the wheels.
