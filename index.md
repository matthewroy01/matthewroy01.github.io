### Opportunity Knocks

* Action Game
* Made in Unity 2017.3
* Team size: 4
* 2018

Opportunity Knocks is a game made for the Global Game Jam 2018 with the theme of "transmission".

Opportunity Knocks has the player controlling a Mars rover remotely from a computer, but the connection is terrible! Use the boost button to increase the framerate but keep an eye on how much power in remaining or else it's game over. The game is played with the num pad where the 3 left and 3 rights buttons control the wheels.

A summer project, this game is a work in progress.
